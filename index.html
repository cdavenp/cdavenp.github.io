      <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Short term;</i></p> Within the next 1-3 months, I would like to further develop myself in my personal character, holistic understanding of finance and market anomalies,
         and secure a summer internship that will allow me to continue to grow in both of these areas. In addition, I would like to continue to cast a broad net in terms of
         exploring the multitude of paths in finance, all in an effort to better inform myself to make a career path decision in the future. 
        
         <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Intermediate term;</i></p> In my next few years at the University of Michigan, I would like to explore my personality in a way that helps me better understand myself.
        I want to continue to nurture my work ethic, decision making abilities, discernment, and critical thinking skills as I develop into the best version of myself that I can 
        possibly be. I would like to continue to narrow my field-interest in finance, and secure sophomore and junior year internships accordingly. By junior year, I would like to have received
        a return offer from a firm thats culture and values match my own. 

        <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Long term;</i></p> After graduating from the University of Michigan, I hope to have found a firm where I can continue to grow at the pace of grace.
        My definition of success has nothing to do with monetary value, and I want my life to reflect that. Although finance is a career that tends to be lucrative and monetarily successful,
        I want to utilize these resources to give back to communities that I have noticed, throughout my life, are often overlooked. I believe that there are two major ways to make an impact: from the outside in, or from the inside out. From the inside out, an individual can go directly into the field that they wish to make a change in.
        From the outside in, an individual can gain the proper resources, materials, and connections that are required, and use those resources to pour into the change that they want to see in the world. Down the line, I wish to start a foundation for individuals with ASD,
        and truly try to not only make a local impact, but also make a social impact and bring greater awareness to what autism is and how each and every individual can be a positive light towards the ASD community.

       </i> Coming from a graduating class of 48, I knew that entering such a large community would be a drastic change for me. I also understood that there would be drastically less people at the Unviersity of Michigan who looked like myself, and I had to embrace that. Especially with the Ross School of Business only
       being only 4% African American, I understood that I would be entering a dynamic community containing certain biases. In the midst of all of these transitions, I was able to find a diverse community of individuals who continue to push me
       to become great. Michigan Interactive Investments has been a cornerstone of my experience at the University of Michigan thus far and I have met some of my best friends through the organization. I recall the night that new members were first notified of their acceptance, and I was ecstatic. I recall joining a Zoom
       call full of inidivuals with completely different backgrounds but all shared a common interest. This was one of the first times that I had seen such a diverse group bond together.   <br>

      <p class="w3-opacity"><i>My Story</i></p>
      On May 20, 2002, doctors diagnosed another African American baby with severe asthma. My parents were informed that I would likely miss many days of school and miss out on many activities that a 'normal kid' would participate in. Throughout elementary and middle school, I enjoyed sports, but would often find myself on the sideline, struggling to breathe with an inhaler in my hand and tears running down my face. I loved school, but would often find myself in the corner of the school office taking my breathing treatment. I made a decision in the very end of eighth grade that this would change in high school. 
      In the beginning of my freshman year of high school, I decided to join a track and field club. My first day of practice, I ended practice on the ground, unable to breathe. 
      As I reached for my inhaler, my coach stopped me, and he told me that I didn’t need it. My first instinct was to look at him with confusion and ask, “What do you mean I don’t 
      need it?” He explained to me that my inhaler was a crutch, and that fighting through the pain naturally would make it easier and easier to breathe over time. By my senior year, 
      I had not missed a single class, and I had become a 4x All State track athlete. The true reward of this experience was not the accolades, but the mindset of perseverance that
       will last a lifetime. 
      Going forward, I wish to engage in continuous learning, understanding how businesses are managed, and recognizing how to assess and add value to a business. 
      I want to create a structure and foundation 
      for my family that will allow the knowledge that I have gained to be passed on.
