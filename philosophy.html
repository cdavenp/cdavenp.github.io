          On May 20, 2002, doctors diagnosed another African American baby with severe asthma. My parents were informed that I would likely miss many days of school and miss out on many activities that a 'normal kid' would participate in. Throughout elementary and middle school, I enjoyed sports, but would often find myself on the sideline, struggling to breathe with an inhaler in my hand and tears running down my face. I loved school, but would often find myself in the corner of the school office taking my breathing treatment. I made a decision in the very end of eighth grade that this would change in high school. 
          In the beginning of my freshman year of high school, I decided to join a track and field club. My first day of practice, I ended practice on the ground, unable to breathe. 
          As I reached for my inhaler, my coach stopped me, and he told me that I didn’t need it. My first instinct was to look at him with confusion and ask, “What do you mean I don’t 
          need it?” He explained to me that my inhaler was a crutch, and that fighting through the pain naturally would make it easier and easier to breathe over time. By my senior year, 
          I had not missed a single class, and I had become a 4x All State track athlete. The true reward of this experience was not the accolades, but the mindset of perseverance that
           will last a lifetime. 
          Going forward, I wish to engage in continuous learning, understanding how businesses are managed, and recognizing how to assess and add value to a business. 
          I want to create a structure and foundation 
          for my family that will allow the knowledge that I have gained to be passed on.
